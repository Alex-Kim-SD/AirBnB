Ensure that your local dev branch is up to date with the remote dev branch. Run the following command to fetch the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git fetch origin dev
Switch to the main branch using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Merge the changes from the dev branch into the main branch using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git merge dev
Now, you can push the changes to the remote main branch:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
