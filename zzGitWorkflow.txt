git push --set-upstream origin dev
This command tells Git to create a new branch on the remote repository named dev that tracks your local dev branch.
The --set-upstream flag (or -u for short) sets the upstream branch for the current branch.

After this, you can simply use git push in the future while you're on the dev branch, and Git will know that you mean to push to dev on the remote repository.

After pushing your changes, you can merge the dev branch into main:

First, checkout to the main branch:

git checkout main

Then, pull the latest changes from the remote main branch (just to make sure you're up to date):

git pull origin main

After you've ensured your main branch is up to date, you can merge the dev branch into main:

git merge dev

This will merge all the changes from dev into main. If there are no conflicts, you can then push main to the remote repository:

git push origin main
