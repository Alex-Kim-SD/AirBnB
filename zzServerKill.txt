Find and kill the process using port 8000:
First, identify the process ID (PID) by running the following command in your terminal:

For Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :8000
For macOS/Linux: lsof -i :8000
You'll see a list of processes using that port. Identify the process ID (PID) and kill it using the following command:

For Windows: taskkill /PID <PID> /F
For macOS/Linux: kill -9 <PID>
Replace <PID> with the process ID you found earlier. After killing the process, you can start your server again with npm start.
